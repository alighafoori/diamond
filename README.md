A new privacy-care & scalable Blockgraph and coins![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8258420/179621699-ad78a919-5ada-4411-8ca9-4a3208f1f37c.png)

These are the Diamond principles:
-	We are still care very much about “Do not trust, Verify” slogan. Therefore, each full node must be able to verify and confirm each and every transaction. Also, any normal computer can become a full node.
-	It is PoS and at the moment, we don't care how the stakes are obtained. 
-	Unlike the other blockchains, the data storage structure on local computers is a DAG (Directed acyclic graph), so it called Blockgraph. 
-	Beside the DAG, each node (better calling full node) has a “Commitments Pool” to maintain super dynamic documents. These documents are regularly (high frequency) created, edited or destroyed and they will never be recorded on the blockgraph. Therefore, more than ninety-nine percent of transactions will never be recorded anywhere! It means strong privacy.
-	Although the core source code (the engine) is minimal, its architecture is plugin-based. Therefore, based on that core, can be written hundreds of plugins that do not touch the original code and at the same time add unlimited features to the ecosystem.
-	The plugins benefit from the “security model” and the “native tokens” of system core.
-	Easy forking is one of the main pillars of Diamond ecosystem. 
-	The "commitments pool" and "Barats protocol" transforms Diamond Blockgraph into a real low cost, scalable and peer-to-peer network for interactions.
-	
-	The source codes, all kind of related information and generated information documents and all derived products and tools of the project are and will be under GPL.V2 license
